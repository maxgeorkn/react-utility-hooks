# Usage

The README covers the basics. This page collects the
longer examples and the notes that did not fit up front.

## Basic

```bash
import { useDebounce, useLocalStorage } from './src';

const debounced = useDebounce(value, 300);
```

## Notes

- useLocalStorage with JSON serialization
- Tiny: no dependencies besides React
